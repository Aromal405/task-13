### `steps_to_start_free_vm.txt` (example content)
1. **Create a Cloud Account:**
   - Sign up for a free Azure, GCP, or AWS account.

2. **Azure: Start a Free VM:**
   - Navigate to the Azure portal.
   - Click on "Create a resource."
   - Select "Virtual Machine."
   - Choose the "Free" tier (B1S or equivalent).
   - Configure the VM settings (OS, region, etc.).
   - Note the public IP address assigned to your VM after creation.

3. **Ping the VM from Kali Linux:**
   - Open a terminal in Kali Linux.
   - Use the command: `ping <your_vm_ip>`
   - If it doesn't work, check the following:
     - Ensure NSG (Network Security Group) rules allow ICMP traffic.
     - Adjust inbound port rules as necessary.

4. **Login to the VM via SSH:**
   - In the terminal, run: `ssh <username>@<your_vm_ip>`
   - Once logged in, execute `ip a` to check network settings.
   - Take a screenshot of the output.

5. **Ping Your Public IP:**
   - Find your public IP by searching "what is my IP" in your web browser.
   - From the VM terminal, run: `ping <your_public_ip>`
   - Take a screenshot of the result.

6. **Explore the VM:**
   - Navigate through the VM, check configurations, or run other commands as needed.

7. **Shutdown and Destroy the VM:**
   - Go back to the Azure portal.
   - Stop the VM.
   - Delete the VM to avoid incurring charges.
